API INTEGRATION:
================================================================================

The frontend expects a FastAPI backend at http://localhost:8000

Endpoints Used:
  GET  /api/v1/deals                    - List all deals
  POST /api/v1/deals                    - Upload & analyze new deal
  GET  /api/v1/deals/{deal_id}          - Fetch single deal with assumptions
  POST /api/v1/deals/{deal_id}/chat     - Chat with AI (SSE streaming)

To Connect:
  1. Edit index.html, line 47
     Change: const DEMO_MODE = true;
     To:     const DEMO_MODE = false;
  
  2. Start your FastAPI backend
  
  3. Refresh browser - app will fetch real data

Demo Mode:
  • When DEMO_MODE = true (default), app shows sample deals
  • All features work perfectly with demo data
  • Perfect for testing UI without backend
  • Switch to false when backend is ready
